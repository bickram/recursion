# recursion
A recursive definition is one in which the defined term appears in the definition itself. Self referential situations often crops up in real life, even if they aren't immediately recognizable as such. For example suppose you wanted to descrive the set of people that make up your ancestors. You could describe them this way:
  Your ancestors = (your parents) + (your parents' ancestors)
Notice how the concept that is being defined, ancestors, shows up in its own definition. This is a recursive definition.

In programming, recursion has a very precise meaning. It refers to a coding technique in which a function calls itself.
